#### The programming experience
It was difficult to follow the steps of the mini ex6 assignment. First I just tried to make something generative, and change some parameters of something I already made, and thought I could find som rules from that afterwards. Meybe I could have done this, but I wasnt satisfied with the image, and decided to start over and do as the assigment told. To make som rules on paper, and then try to implement them in a program. This approach I found quite interesting, since it showed me, that a few very simple rules can generate something you wouldnt have imagined. So I made three rules, made a program of them, and was quite quickly satisfied afterwards. 

#### What are the rules in your generative program and describe how your program performs over time. What have been generated?
The program evolves be chance. This means that everytime draw runs, it takes a random number between 0 and 1, and regarding what the number is, it draws a specific object. Each time drawy runs the x,y coordinate for the object increases by 4, until it reaches the width of the canvas, then is starts over. but you can see a transparent picture of the precios run behind it. 

##### The rules: 
1) Take a random number between 0 and 1. 
2) From 0-25 draw line in center of canvas, loop this line a hundred times, showing 10 of the loops. to create a different visual. 
From 25-50 draw a triangle in the center of the canvas. 
From 50-75 draw a rectangle in the center of the canvas. 
From 75-100 draw a cirkel in the center of the canvas. 
3) Increase radius (x,y) by 4 each time draw runs. 


#### How does this mini-exericse help you to understand what might be generativity?(To reflect upon the concept of generativity theoretically and practically, such as rules, temporality, authorship, emergence and processes.)

As I wrote before, a few very simple rules can generate something quite interesting, so I have begun to think about what several rules in a program can generate, and how it is possible to build upon this subject of generativity. 

Apart form that I have to admit that I havent had the time to reflect more upon the subject, and reflect theoretically. 


##### Changes I could have made
Use the for loop in another way. It contributes to the program, but i could have had a bigger effect on the visual if I have used it differently, but I couldnt come up with a way to do it. 

I would have liked to do something with sound, so each kind of object made a controlled a specific sound.
