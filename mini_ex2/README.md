#### The programming experience
In this mini exercise my goal was to use a syntax, and change the parameters. 
I wanted to get familiar with the coordinatesystem, so I easily could draw, or place something in a future program. It took some time to figure out how the different shapes function, and what their coordinates were. But through practice I figured it out. 

I' ve used diff'rent shapes, and different colors. The colorsyntax I used, was the one of RGB. The colors I have chosen for the static visuals, are yellow, blue, white, green and red. The color aesthetic symbolizes the coding state I'm at. That I havent advanced my skills to much yet, and therefor chosen simple colors to work with. 

I have experimented with the different sections/functions of set up and draw. I have tried to place the same thing in both functions to see what the outcome is, it isn't always clear what diffrence it makes, apart from being static or continually drawn. But sometimes one syntax wouldnt work in set up, but worked perfectly in draw. This I will examine futher, in my following exercises. 

When I first got famliar with the shape, color, fill commando's etc.  I didnt need to copy, or read what I had to do. I was free to use these commandoes as a part of a language, like I'am able to form a sentence with a specific meaning with my natural langauge. Reading code could be difficult, if I wasnt first familiar with the syntaxes is consisted of. Therefor I didnt use a code that had elements I didnt understand. 

My first idea with the program was to make a computer that presented statements about computational practice. About how you could learn, or statements as "PLEASE learn me to code", to make a program that could inform people about the importance of being aware of the software, or programs we use everyday. Therefor the computer in the visual only had one button, it could do anything else than inform, and anybody could use it, then it is up to the viewer if he/she dares to be informed. The qoutes could be possitive or negative, so you wouldnt know what you were presented with. 

In lack of knowledge about the effect programming, and computational practice has, (I was not able to come up with qoutes), I changed it into comments from trump, and to the idea of "do you dare to listen to trump, you might get dumb". The qoutes is picked out from twitter, but could eventually be automatically uploaded when trump makes a tweet. 

My first program was very simple, but it is a step towards learning the language of javescript through simple use of syntaxes.
